# **Overview**
This repository consists of three projects that aim to demonstrate the application of data analysis and machine learning techniques to drive business decisions and improve predictive capabilities. The projects are designed to showcase the power of data-driven insights in various domains
# **Project's Description**
### Project 1 : 
This is a regression analysis project that aims to predict city-cycle fuel consumption in miles per gallon based on 3 multivalued discrete and 5 continuous attributes. The project uses linear and polynomial regression models to analyze the data and evaluates their performance using metrics such as mean absolute error, mean absolute percentage error, and R-squared score.
### Project 2 :
This is a logistic regression project to predict whether a data point belongs to a Hill or a Valley class based on 100 features. The project includes data preprocessing, scaling, and model evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The model achieved an accuracy of 71%, but it struggled with Class 1 (Valley) and is biased towards Class 0 (Hill). The project also includes a random sample prediction using the same steps as the training data.
### Project 3 :
This project uses a Random Forest Regressor model to predict the sales of items in a retail store based on various features such as item characteristics, outlet features, and other relevant variables. The model is trained and evaluated using a dataset of 14,204 samples, and the results show a reasonable degree of accuracy with a mean squared error of approximately 1200, mean absolute error of approximately 30, and an R-squared score of approximately 0.85. The model can be used to drive business decisions and optimize revenue by identifying the most profitable items and outlets, optimizing pricing and inventory strategies, and improving supply chain management.
